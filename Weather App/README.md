----
In the future, new figures will be added: lizard and spok. The game will work according to the rule:

> Scissors cut the paper. Paper wraps around the stone. The stone crushes the lizard, and the lizard hounds Spock, while Spock breaks the scissors, which in turn cut off the head of the lizard, which is eating the paper on which there is evidence against Spock. Spock vaporizes the stone, and the stone, of course, dulls the scissors.
